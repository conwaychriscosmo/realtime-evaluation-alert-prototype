# Real-Time Evaluation System Prototype

## Overview
This prototype for a Real-Time Evaluation System was developed with an innovative approach, leveraging GitHub Copilot's capabilities. In an impressive timeframe of approximately three hours, the majority of the codebase was constructed through a process akin to copy-pasting from GitHub Copilot's suggestions. This method not only expedited development but also ensured that the prototype was built with best practices in mind.

## Local Setup Instructions
To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Variables:**
   Set up the necessary environment variables or add them to a `.env` file:
   ```sh
   export FLASK_APP=app.py
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   # Add other necessary environment variables here
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   Ensure that `db.create_all()` is called within the application context in `app.py`.

6. **Run the Application:**
   ```sh
   flask run
   ```

## API Endpoints

The system exposes two main endpoints for the `Message` resource:

- **POST /message**: Create a new message.
- **GET /message/<message_id>**: Retrieve an existing message by ID.

### Using the POST Endpoint

To create a new message, use the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/message \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "agentId": "agent123",
           "customerId": 456789,
           "messageId": 78910,
           "messageText": "Your issue has been resolved.",
           "sentimentScore": "positive"
         }'
```

### Using the GET Endpoint

To retrieve an existing message, use the following `curl` command:

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/message/78910
```

Replace `78910` with the actual `messageId` you wish to retrieve.

## Conclusion

This prototype serves as a testament to the efficiency and effectiveness of AI-assisted development. By utilizing GitHub Copilot, we've demonstrated that it's possible to rapidly prototype a complex system with minimal manual coding.

Please replace `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git` with the actual URL of your repository and ensure that all environment variables and setup instructions are accurate for your project.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of the project, detailed setup instructions, and documentation of the API endpoints with `curl` commands for easy testing. If you need any further assistance or modifications, feel free to ask. Happy coding! üòäüìù
